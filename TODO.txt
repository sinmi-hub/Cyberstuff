Finish implementing Vignre Cipher and inherent logic
Implement Ploybius Cipher
Create a scheme that layers both of the classical
Construct a polynomial time and efficient attack on shift cipher.
Result of Caesar's cipher still seems to be capitalized wrong - FIXED
Frequency analysis was performed on filename, instead of content on file - FIXED
Ensure shift s cipher is robust enough to encrypt numbers. Need to think of good logic
